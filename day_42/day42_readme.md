## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies

**Required packages:**
```bash
pip install requests tkinter
```

**Optional (for voice features):**
```bash
pip install pyttsx3 speechrecognition pyaudio
```

*Note: Voice features are optional – the app works perfectly without them!*

### 2. API Key Setup

1. Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)
2. Get your free API key
3. Replace in `smart_weather_app.py`:
   ```python
   API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
   ```

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
python smart_weather_app.py
```

Choose your preferred mode:
- **Option 1:** GUI Dashboard (recommended)
- **Option 2:** Console Mode (classic CLI)
