# 🧠 Python + AI Journey
Hey there!

Welcome to my learning journey where I document every step as I go from zero to hero in **Python**, **AI tools**, and building real-world applications.

### 🌱 What This Repo Is
This repository serves as:

* A **daily log** of progress (mini-scripts, concepts, projects)
* A showcase of what **consistency + curiosity** can build
* A resource for others starting their journey in Python + AI

## 🚀 Day 1: Hello, World!
My very first Python script:

```python
print("Hello, World! I am Boya Uday Kumar, and I’m starting my new journey in Python and AI.")
```
