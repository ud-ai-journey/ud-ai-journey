**Day 92 of the 100 Days Python & AI Challenge**

> *A magical journey into self-reflection, emotional growth, and creative storytelling for kids!*

## üöÄ The Journey

Today, we set out to build something truly special: a digital diary that helps kids express their feelings, build the habit of reflection, and receive gentle, wise feedback from a friendly AI companion. The goal? To make journaling fun, emotionally impactful, and a cherished daily ritual.

### 1. Laying the Foundation
We started by designing a modular project structure‚Äîready for rapid prototyping and future growth. With folders for models, utilities, data, and more, KidDiary.ai is built to scale and adapt.

### 2. Bringing the Magic to Life
- **Streamlit UI**: A playful, kid-friendly interface for easy journaling.
- **Emotion Classifier**: An offline-friendly, keyword-based model to detect feelings in every entry.
- **Diary Story Generator**: AI rephrases each thought into a magical story, making every day memorable.
- **Doodle the Diary Dragon**: Our wise, kind companion who always knows just what to say.
- **Local JSON Storage**: Every entry is saved and visualized in a colorful timeline, complete with mood emoji.

### 3. The Experience
Kids simply type about their day‚Äî"I played with my puppy and it was fun!"‚Äîand KidDiary.ai does the rest:
- Detects the emotion and assigns a mood color/emoji
- Rewrites the entry as a magical story
- Doodle the Diary Dragon offers kind, encouraging feedback
- The entry is saved and shown on a vibrant timeline
