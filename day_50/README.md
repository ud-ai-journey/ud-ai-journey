# 🎉 Day 50 Milestone – CLI Text Poster Generator 🖼️🧠

Welcome to **Day 50** of my Python + AI learning journey!  
Today marks a special milestone — **50 days of consistent coding, learning, and growing**.  
To celebrate, I built a fun, interactive **Command-Line Text Poster Generator** that blends creativity and code. ✨

---

## 🛠️ What It Does

This project lets you **create stunning ASCII-style posters** of your text — right in the terminal!  
You can customize the look and feel of your poster using:

🔤 **Text Input** – Add your custom message or multiline quote  
🔲 **Fill Characters** – Use `*`, `#`, `❤️`, or anything you like  
📐 **Frame Styles** – Choose from none, basic (`====`), or double (`═══`) borders  
🎨 **Text Colors** – Highlight your poster with terminal colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow)  
💾 **Save to File** – Export your final design to a `.txt` file for safekeeping

## 💡 Features

- **Interactive CLI Menu**
- **Dynamic Text Rendering**
- **Custom Fill Characters**
- **Colorful Output using ANSI Escape Sequences**
- **Frame Styles (None, Basic, Double)**
- **Saves Poster to File**

## 🌟 Why This Matters

This isn’t just a fun CLI project — it’s a **symbol of 50 days of growth, perseverance, and creative coding**.
Each feature was carefully crafted using fundamental Python concepts: loops, strings, conditionals, input/output, and file handling.

> "Code is not just logic — it's a form of art, expression, and celebration." – Me on Day 50 🧠✨

## 🗂️ Tech Stack

* Python 3.12+
* ANSI Escape Codes for colors
* Pure standard library – no external packages!
