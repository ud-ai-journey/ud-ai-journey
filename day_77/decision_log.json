It's not just about pursuing opportunity, but also about ensuring that the path aligns with our core values and supports our overall well-being. Consider whether you're running *to* something exciting, or running *away* from something uncomfortable.",
      "recommendation": "Before making a final decision, conduct thorough research on your target country. This includes investigating job opportunities, visa requirements, cost of living, cultural norms, and healthcare systems. Try to connect with people who have already made a similar move and gather insights from their experiences. If possible, consider a short-term trip to the country to experience it firsthand. If after all this, you still feel a strong pull and the risks seem manageable with thorough planning, then take the leap. However, if doubt lingers and the challenges seem insurmountable, exploring alternative paths for growth within your current environment might be a more suitable option.",
