- **Built the MVP** in Bolt, getting the core features up and running fast
- **Moved to Cursor** for deeper enhancements and a smoother dev experience
- **Designed and enhanced the landing page** to make a great first impression
- **Integrated EmailJS** for seamless email delivery
- **Added export functionality** for PDF and Notion templates
- **Implemented Google Drive integration** for secure, scalable report sharing via email
- **Tested the full flow**‚Äîfrom upload to analysis to export to email, all in one day!

> I started this morning with a decision to build CareerFlow.ai today‚Äîand I made it happen. The attached mail report is proof that with focus, the right tools, and a bit of AI magic, you can turn an idea into a working product in a single day.
